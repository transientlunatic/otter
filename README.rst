Otter
===============================


Otter is a simple HTML report generator for Python jobs. Otter was
designed to produce reports on long-running jobs on remote machines,
and send them to a web server, but it's able to process many different
outputs from Python scripts, and convert them into neat and readible HTML pages.

Otter makes use of Twitter Bootstrap to make an easily themed layout for its output.
