Otter - A Python Report Generator
=================================

Otter is a package for Python which is designed to make outputting and managing the results of programs which may take a long time to run,
orwhich may produce a very large quantity of results.
It was designed for handling the output requirements of data analysis pipelines used in astrophysics,
but it's capable of handling a wide range of data outputs.

Otter is also highly customisable, and you can use the ``liquid`` templating language to produce new output templates.
